First two layers are 400, 300 units in size. The first 2 layers use relu as activation functions and the final layer uses tanh. \n",

After I removed the weight_decay accidentally on one of the agent I noticed that it was starting to succeeded at tracking the ball while the other was not. I removed it from both and finally was able to solve the problem. I may have had the values for weight decay set incorrectly. \n",
